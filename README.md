## Final Project
Course: 
- CSC 7301: Software and Programming I

This repo is the final project for Software and Programming I. The project I have chosen is
one I remember from my childhood, which is Flappy Bird. This is a pygame parody to attempt to match
the game I grew up with, while using object-oriented programming and Python.
